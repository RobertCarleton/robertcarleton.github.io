                        I am a 21 year old Student studying Games Development in ATU Sligo. I am currently in my 3rd and Final Year of the course. Originally from Mayo. Have created several mini projects over the past 10 years, here is a sample of a few.

                        This is a current project in development for our Project300 Module. All 4 of us from the course group have teamed up to create this game. Thus far, we have gotten the main fundamentals down. My main task so far has been Level Designer, Story Director and Musician. I created the world our Player sets off to explore in on their quest. I was able to transfer my skills from using Blender and Unity for years, over to Unreal for creating the diverse environment in this project!

                        In this mini project my team and I were tasked with developing a rogue-like game, with procedurally generated levels. I personally took on the part of UI, Skybox Art, Music, and programmer assistant (mainly with the level up system). I was also appointed team leader for the project. Of course, our enemies and player lack visuals and animations, but we were able to create a decent building block for a game with this project!

                        For this mini project, we were tasked to create our own 2D Platformer. For a first year project it turned out quite decent, visually appealing to say the least. The project was of course inspired by The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. That game hadn't released, so myself and my other teammate took it upon ourselves to tell our own version of the events that would occur in Tears of the Kingdom - for one, Zelda is playable in this!
